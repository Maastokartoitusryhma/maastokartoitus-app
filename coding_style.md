<h1>Coding style</h1>

<h2>ESLint</h2>

Our project uses ESLint to ensure that the following rules are followed:<br/>

* Indent: 2 spaces
* No trailing spaces
* Single quotes ' ' instead of double quotes " "
* No semicolons
* Equality comparison is '===' instead of '=='
* Comma is followed by space
* Object curly spacing: OK: { a, b, c }, Wrong: {a, b, c}
* Arrow spacing: OK:(a) => { }, Wrong: (a)=>{ }

<h2>Naming conventions</h2>

* Variable and method names are written in camelCase
* Component names start with Capital letters
