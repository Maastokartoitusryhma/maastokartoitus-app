# Definition of Done

## Code reviews

Our definition of done requires that the story must be reviewed by another developer after the person who had worked on the 
story thinks that it's ready. Stories that are waiting for the review are in "REVIEW" status in the sprint backlog. After
someone has reviewed the code for the story, it can be marked as done, unless errors are found.

## Tasks

A story is done if and only if all of its tasks are done.
